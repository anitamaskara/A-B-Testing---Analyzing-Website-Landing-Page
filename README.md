# Analyzing-Website-Landing-Page-A-B-Test-Results

Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Conducted hypothesis testing in python to help company find out whether the new website landing page has higher usersâ€™ convert rate than old page using Pandas. I performed regression analysis using two method -- Using loop to similate 10,000 experiment using numpy.random.choice() function and another method is to use StatsModel package to run logistic regression model. Lastly, I also merge another dataset and measured effect of country factor using sklearn and interpret results with practical reasoning.
